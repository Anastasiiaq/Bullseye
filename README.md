# Bullseye

Bullseye is a simple iOS game built with SwiftUI.

The goal of the game is to bring the bullseye as close as possible to the goal. The bullseye is located on a slider that moves from 1 to 100, and the target value is selected randomly. The closer you get to the target value the more points you score.

The Bullseye game tutorial from Ray Wenderlich's The iOS Apprentice book.
