# Bullseye

Bullseye is a simple iOS game built with SwiftUI.

The goal of the game is to bring the bullseye as close as possible to the goal. The bullseye is located on a slider that moves from 1 to 100, and the target value is selected randomly. The closer you get to the target value the more points you score.
